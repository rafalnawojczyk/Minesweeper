## General info

Modern looking Minesweeper game made in Vanilla Javascript using classes, MVC architecture, SASS, private methods and properties.

I created this game to use all the JS knowledge I got, and as well to check how MVC architecture helps in building web apps. Game has some nice features - first click is always an empty cell that reveals lots of space on board, there are nice animations made for flag deleting, nice confetti on revealing cells(reduced on mobiles due to performance issues).
